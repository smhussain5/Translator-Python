# TRANSLATOR PYTHON

![Translator Python GIF Demonstration](https://github.com/smhussain5/Translator-Python/blob/main/TRANSLATER_PYTHON.gif?raw=true)

## Problem ðŸ¤”

Being able to connect with people from different countries is one of the most powerful features of the internet. This rapid globalization necessitates the need for applications that help translate text to various languages to facilitate communication.

## Solution ðŸ’¡

This terminal application utilizes Google Translator's API to convert text from english to one of 10 languages. The original text is displayed with the translated text below. Users have the option to translate as often as they want.

## Quick Start âš¡

If you have Docker installed, you can run this application on your own machine with just 2 steps!
<br>
<br>
Pull the image from Docker Hub
```python
docker pull smhussain5/translator-python
```
Then run the image as an interactive Docker container
```python
docker run --rm -it smhussain5/translator-python
```
## Technologies Used âš™

- Googletrans
- PyCharm
- Python

## Challenges ðŸ’¢

This was a straightforward application, but I originally had options for languages that utilized non-Latin alphabet (eg, Korean, Russian). Although this worked in the PyCharm terminal, it did not translate (ðŸ˜‰) to the Python shell.

## Insights ðŸ’­

I enjoyed using this library and did not utilize the full array of features like auto-detection. It would be interesting to explore using text-to-speech and maybe developing a full-stack Google Translate clone!
